# Detect Vehicle in Wrong Lane

This project leverages **computer vision** and **deep learning** techniques to detect vehicles traveling in the wrong lane. A lightweight and efficient detection model based on **YOLOv11n** is employed, with further optimization using **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**. The system supports real-time object detection, tracking, and violation analysis, and is designed to run smoothly on low-power devices such as the **Raspberry Pi 5**.

## Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent system that can:
1. **Train** a custom vehicle detection model using **YOLOv11n**.
2. **Optimize** the model with **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** to reduce size and improve inference time.
3. **Detect and track** vehicles using **YOLOv11n** and **ByteTrack**, then compare their positions against predefined lane boundaries to identify violations.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Real-Time Detection:** Accurately detects wrong-lane driving behavior.
- üöÄ **Quantized Model:** Optimized using PTQ for improved performance and lower resource usage.
- üéØ **Accurate Classification:** Supports motorbikes, cars, trucks, and buses.
- üíª **Edge Deployment:** Efficiently runs on embedded systems like Raspberry Pi 5.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv11n** ‚Äì Object detection architecture.
- **Ultralytics** ‚Äì YOLO training/export toolkit.
- **OpenVINO** ‚Äì For INT8 model inference optimization.
- **Python**, **OpenCV** ‚Äì For image processing and application logic.
- **ByteTrack** ‚Äì Multi-object tracking framework.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DangUIT/Detect-the-vehicles-in-wrong-lane.git
cd Detect-the-vehicles-in-wrong-lane
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip install -U pip
pip install ultralytics[export]
```



## Usage

### 1. Navigate to source directory
```bash
cd ./src
```

### 2. Run Detection

#### On **Windows**:
```bash
.\run_pvd.bat
.\run_bentre.bat
```

#### On **Raspberry Pi 5**:
```bash
./run_pvd.sh
./run_bentre.sh
```

## Model Optimization

- **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):**  
  The model is converted to **INT8** format using **OpenVINO**, which significantly improves inference speed and reduces model size. This allows for smooth and efficient deployment on embedded platforms such as Raspberry Pi, with minimal accuracy degradation.
