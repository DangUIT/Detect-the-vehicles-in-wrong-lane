## Overview
The project aims to detect vehicles driving in the wrong lane using a custom-trained YOLOv9 model. It involves:
1. **Training the Dataset:** A custom vehicle dataset was trained using YOLOv9.  
2. **Model Optimization:** 
   - **Post-training Quantization (PTQ):** To reduce memory usage and inference time.
   - **Quantization Aware Training (QAT):** To minimize accuracy loss while reducing computation costs.
3. **Detection and Counting:** YOLO-based object counting is implemented to accurately detect and track lane violations.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection:** Identifies vehicles in the wrong lane in real-time.
- **Optimized Model:** Improved performance with post-training quantization and QAT.
- **Object Counting:** Tracks the number of vehicles for precise detection and reporting.
- **Scalable:** Can be adapted to different traffic scenarios and datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv9** – for model training and object detection  
- **TensorFlow** – for model optimization (PTQ & QAT)  
- **Python** – main programming language  
- **OpenCV** – for image and video processing  
- **CUDA** – optional, for GPU acceleration during inference

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DangUIT/Detect-the-vehicles-in-wrong-lane.git
   cd Detect-the-vehicles-in-wrong-lane
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure Python 3.x is installed, then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download YOLOv9 Weights:**  
   Download the pre-trained YOLOv9 weights and place them in the `weights/` directory.

4. **Prepare Dataset:**  
   Place your training data in the `data/` folder, following YOLO's dataset structure.

## Usage
### 1. Train the YOLOv9 Model
   ```bash
   python train.py --data data.yaml --cfg yolov9.yaml --weights weights/yolov9.pt --epochs 50
   ```

### 2. Apply Post-Training Quantization
   ```bash
   python quantize.py --weights weights/yolov9.pt --quantization ptq
   ```

### 3. Quantization Aware Training
   ```bash
   python qat.py --data data.yaml --weights weights/yolov9.pt --epochs 10
   ```

### 4. Run Detection on a Video Stream
   ```bash
   python detect.py --source video.mp4 --weights weights/yolov9-quantized.pt
   ```

### 5. Track and Count Vehicles
   ```bash
   python object_counter.py --video video.mp4 --weights weights/yolov9-quantized.pt
   ```

## Model Optimization
1. **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):**  
   This technique compresses the trained model by reducing the bit-width of the weights, improving efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy.  

2. **Quantization Aware Training (QAT):**  
   QAT simulates the effects of quantization during training, leading to a model that retains higher accuracy when quantized.

## Results
- **Performance:**  
   - Achieved significant reduction in model size and inference time with PTQ and QAT.
   - Minimal accuracy loss compared to the original YOLOv9 model.

- **Detection Accuracy:**  
   - Precision: 98%  
   - Recall: 95%  

- **Inference Speed:**  
   - ~30 FPS on GPU  
   - ~10 FPS on CPU
